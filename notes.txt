 The try-with-resources is a more elegant and efficient way to guarantee that the resources witch implements the
 AutoCloseable interface be correctly closed, even an exception occurred during the try block.
 In this case, when the block try is finished, the session is automatically closed, even the session.close() is
 not called:
        try (Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().openSession()) {}
