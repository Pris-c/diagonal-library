# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage a library's book inventory. This
project uses PostgreSQL as the database, integrates with Hibernate for database interaction, utilizes Maven for
dependency management and project build, and employs Log4j for logging, ensuring logs are recorded in a file for better
user experience.

## Features

- **Main Menu:** The main menu provides an intuitive interface for users to perform various actions, including listing all books, adding new books, searching for books, updating book information, and deleting books.

- **Listing Books:** Users can view a list of all books in the library. If the library is empty, a corresponding message  is displayed.

- **Adding Books:** Enrich the library by adding new books, providing details such as title, author, and publication
  year.

- **Searching for Books:** The application supports searching for books based on title, author, publication year, and
  ID.

- **Updating Book Information:** Modify the information of existing books, including the title, author, and publication
  year.

- **Deleting Books:** Remove books from the library by providing their unique ID.
